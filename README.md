### **段子积累**

**Education**

> I believe that parents' involvement in most American public schools has been declining. Today, parents are puzzled by all the new teaching methods and new terminology(术语) used to introduce them. They can't find out what their kids are supposed to be learning, let alone(更别提) whether or not they are being properly educated. The shortage of textbooks, the flexibility of standards, the lack of work coming home, the computerized report cards - all help to keep parents away from schooling. And well-intentioned teachers have been effectively discouraging parents from helping their kids at home on the grounds(理由是) that the students may be confused by the different approaches. The result? Even more distance.[家长很难融入教育体系；电子化的教育；多样化的教育模式会confuse]

> Other challenges that students face are the constant temptations(诱惑) that surround them every day. Cell phones, music players and even video games are all being carried into classrooms. With the general noise and confusion in today's classroom, it's easy to hide and even use them during class, which prevents the user and often people around them from getting the most out of the curriculum(课程).[学生上课打游戏听音乐影响学习，影响周围人]


**Animals**

> Pets can substitute for the absence of other family members. Sometimes a couple who is unable to have children will adopt pets and treat them like babies. They shower on their pets the love that they might have provided a child and receive affection and companionship in return. Many people who live alone enjoy the companionship of a pet instead of loved ones who are at a distance or have passed away. The pet becomes a family member for these people and deserve the same kind of treatment that a family menber would have.[宠物：无法生育养宠物；返还爱慕和陪伴；为孤独的人替代不在身边的亲人；值得像被家庭成员一样对待]

**Friends**

> Close friendships have numerous benefits. For one thing, loyal friends are always there to support each other, no matter what happens. Some friendships last many years, becoming deeper and more meaningful with time. Also, people can be themselves with friends. No one has to worry about not being perfect when he/she is among friends. Finally, nothing can be more satisfying than the intimate(亲密的) conversations that true friends can have. They can confide(吐露) in and trust each other.[友情：永远支持彼此；随时间强化；放松，展现真正的自己；满足于亲密的交流，吐露真情]

**Technology**

> I believe technology can positively contribute to humans's keeping alive of traditional skills and ways of life. For example, the populations of some Pacific islands are too small to have regular schools. Their educational authorities have been able to use the Internet to deliver schooling online to the local kids rather than sending them to the mainland. Also, the modern refrigeration technology has been used to keep alive the traditional ways of producing salmon. As a result, they can now be ordered from and delivered to anywhere in the world.[科技：网络教育惠及偏远地区；冷藏技术降新鲜水果运往远方]

**Leisure** - **Sports**

> Many people enjoy participating in sports for recreation(娱乐) because it offers an opportunity to be part of a group. As a participant, you can join a team and enjoy all the benefits of membership, from shared experiences to a sense of belonging. Moreover, in training for a sport, an exercise routine contributes to your health.    
> Probably even more important than group identity and good health are the life lessons that participation in a sport provides. Setting a goal and working toward it, collaborating with others and putting a plan into action are all good lessons that can be learned on the playing field.[足球：paticipate a Team；sense of belonging; health; a goal and working toward it;]

**Transportation**

> I don't think biking is a safe means of transportation in America - for three reasons. To begin with, in my experience, many different pieces of bicycle equipment can be unreliable and may cause bike accidents. For instance, if a bike does not have good brakes(车刹), it cannot be stopped effcively. Similarly, a weak light will make it difficult for a biker to see at night. Aside from defective(有缺陷的) equipment, a biker may have difficulty controlling his/her bike when it's windy or rainy, which is common in many American cities. Under such conditions, water may obstruct(阻挡) the biker's view. And I believe most bike accidents are actually caused by bikers who do not stop at a stop sign or by bikers whose pants' legs get caught in the bike chain.[自行车不好：有缺陷的零件->accidents（车刹，车灯）; 风雨天容易accidents； 不遵守交通规则accidents；]

**Government** - **Healthcare**

> Socialized health care systems generally don't make sense. First, socialized medicine is extremely expensive - no matter how it is paid for. For example, in Sweden and Saudi Arabia(沙特阿拉伯), two medically socialized countries, the costs have increased to approximately 40 percent of the budget(预算) of each country each year. Specifically, in Sweden, this money comes from high taxes while in Saudi Arabia, it comes from petrodollars. More than that, the socialized system is rarely efficient. Often, it's hard to find an appropriate doctor. Worse yet(更糟糕的是), it's even harder to get examined by a doctor. According to one recent case in Algeria, a woman had to wait eight months just to have her tooth pulled out. That's because in countries with socialized medicine, everyone wants to go to the doctor or dentist, no matter how small the problem might be.[社会医疗不好：非常耗资（国家40%预算）-> high taxes；效率低下（小病也要去看->等八个月拔一颗牙）]
