### **段子积累**

**独立写作**

With the accelerating development of our society, arts and athletics have been playing two important roles in our daily life. It's hard to judge which has more significance

**Education**

> I believe that parents' involvement in most American public schools has been declining. Today, parents are puzzled by all the new teaching methods and new terminology(术语) used to introduce them. They can't find out what their kids are supposed to be learning, let alone(更别提) whether or not they are being properly educated. The shortage of textbooks, the flexibility of standards, the lack of work coming home, the computerized report cards - all help to keep parents away from schooling. And well-intentioned teachers have been effectively discouraging parents from helping their kids at home on the grounds(理由是) that the students may be confused by the different approaches. The result? Even more distance.[家长很难融入教育体系；电子化的教育；多样化的教育模式会confuse]

> Other challenges that students face are the constant temptations(诱惑) that surround them every day. Cell phones, music players and even video games are all being carried into classrooms. With the general noise and confusion in today's classroom, it's easy to hide and even use them during class, which prevents the user and often people around them from getting the most out of the curriculum(课程).[学生上课打游戏听音乐影响学习，影响周围人]


**Animals**

> Pets can substitute for the absence of other family members. Sometimes a couple who is unable to have children will adopt pets and treat them like babies. They shower on their pets the love that they might have provided a child and receive affection and companionship in return. Many people who live alone enjoy the companionship of a pet instead of loved ones who are at a distance or have passed away. The pet becomes a family member for these people and deserve the same kind of treatment that a family menber would have.[宠物：无法生育养宠物；返还爱慕和陪伴；为孤独的人替代不在身边的亲人；值得像被家庭成员一样对待]

**Friends**

> Close friendships have numerous benefits. For one thing, loyal friends are always there to support each other, no matter what happens. Some friendships last many years, becoming deeper and more meaningful with time. Also, people can be themselves with friends. No one has to worry about not being perfect when he/she is among friends. Finally, nothing can be more satisfying than the intimate(亲密的) conversations that true friends can have. They can confide(吐露) in and trust each other.[友情：永远支持彼此；随时间强化；放松，展现真正的自己；满足于亲密的交流，吐露真情]

**Technology**

> I believe technology can positively contribute to humans's keeping alive of traditional skills and ways of life. For example, the populations of some Pacific islands are too small to have regular schools. Their educational authorities have been able to use the Internet to deliver schooling online to the local kids rather than sending them to the mainland. Also, the modern refrigeration technology has been used to keep alive the traditional ways of producing salmon. As a result, they can now be ordered from and delivered to anywhere in the world.[科技：网络教育惠及偏远地区；冷藏技术降新鲜水果运往远方]

**Leisure** - **Sports**

> Many people enjoy participating in sports for recreation(娱乐) because it offers an opportunity to be part of a group. As a participant, you can join a team and enjoy all the benefits of membership, from shared experiences to a sense of belonging. Moreover, in training for a sport, an exercise routine contributes to your health.    
> Probably even more important than group identity and good health are the life lessons that participation in a sport provides. Setting a goal and working toward it, collaborating with others and putting a plan into action are all good lessons that can be learned on the playing field.[足球：paticipate a Team；sense of belonging; health; a goal and working toward it;]

**Transportation**

> I don't think biking is a safe means of transportation in America - for three reasons. To begin with, in my experience, many different pieces of bicycle equipment can be unreliable and may cause bike accidents. For instance, if a bike does not have good brakes(车刹), it cannot be stopped effcively. Similarly, a weak light will make it difficult for a biker to see at night. Aside from defective(有缺陷的) equipment, a biker may have difficulty controlling his/her bike when it's windy or rainy, which is common in many American cities. Under such conditions, water may obstruct(阻挡) the biker's view. And I believe most bike accidents are actually caused by bikers who do not stop at a stop sign or by bikers whose pants' legs get caught in the bike chain.[自行车不好：有缺陷的零件->accidents（车刹，车灯）; 风雨天容易accidents； 不遵守交通规则accidents；]

**Government** - **Healthcare**

> Socialized health care systems generally don't make sense. First, socialized medicine is extremely expensive - no matter how it is paid for. For example, in Sweden and Saudi Arabia(沙特阿拉伯), two medically socialized countries, the costs have increased to approximately 40 percent of the budget(预算) of each country each year. Specifically, in Sweden, this money comes from high taxes while in Saudi Arabia, it comes from petrodollars. More than that, the socialized system is rarely efficient. Often, it's hard to find an appropriate doctor. Worse yet(更糟糕的是), it's even harder to get examined by a doctor. According to one recent case in Algeria, a woman had to wait eight months just to have her tooth pulled out. That's because in countries with socialized medicine, everyone wants to go to the doctor or dentist, no matter how small the problem might be.[社会医疗不好：非常耗资（国家40%预算）-> high taxes；效率低下（小病也要去看->等八个月拔一颗牙）]



### **口语素材**

** The Peking Zoo **

> I really enjoy spending time with plants and animals.   
> Fresh air, Good smell of flowers, Cute animals make me relax, loose my tensions/pressure.   
> I also like to study animals and plants.   
> Seeing them in front of their faces can make me better understand them than from the textbooks.   
> And those signs, in front of each kind of plants or animals, with descriptions on it, help me knowing them better.   

适用问题：
> Think of one place where you have never visited but where you would really like to go. Explain what it is that interests you about this place.

** Childhood is important **

> Friends: You can make friends when you are child. You play with them, then you became friends! and with time past, the friendship became deeper and deeper. Most adult people's best friend are from their childhood. The friendship is pure and unforgetable.  
> Interests: Your interests also depend on the things you do during your childhood. For example, when I was 8 or 9 years old, I started to learn ice-skatting, with my friends. Although I only study it for one year, it now become my most favourite sports and I'm really good at it, among those amateurs. 


### **口语模版**

Q3 

reading会给你一个announcement/letter等，内容涉及一个proposal等，会给出两个理由来支撑opinion  
Listening part 一男一女进行对话，其中一人具有鲜明观点--agree or disagree 但是注意！80%情况下主人公会给出三个point，而不是大多人认为的两个。其中两个是针对reading的回应，另外一个是新延伸的point  

模版一

> 第一句话：A letter from a student suggests that…because( ) and also( ).如果是学校通知，那第一句话就可以是：The university announced to ( ) because and also( ).    
> 第二句： The student in the conversation strongly agrees/disagrees with the proposal.     
> 理由：Firstly, she points out that… Also, she says that…

模版二

1）表达观点 agree or disagree + reading的main point
2) r1 (reading reference1) + p1, f1 (listening内容)
3) r2 (reading reference2) + p2, f2
4) p3 f3 ( further point, 无reading 对应)

来看具体答法 
1） In the conversation, the m/w (dis)agrees with ...main point... in the reading material. And (s)he has given several reasons. 
2) First, with the regard to the wish/claim/concern in the reading material that ...r1..., he/she mentioned that ...f1... , and thus ...p1...
3) Also, facing the wish/claim/concern ... r2... , he/she points out that... p2... , as ...f2...
4) Finally, he she further stated that...p3/f3


Q4

Reading中会讲一个terminology术语，标题即内容。这个术语的解释会分为两组key word
Listening中professor会讲一个case说明此术语，并且请谨记，case中一定会出现相应内容和key word 1 / key word 2分别对应！
试想，如果让你解释清一个术语，你要做的其实就是解释清那两个key word就OK了。
那联系到答题怎么答呢？
1.概括reading中术语内容
2.听力材料case描述
3.听力材料illustration 1 与 key word 1 对应
4.听力材料illustration 2 与 key word 2 对应

1.先讲reading: According to the reading material, (topic) enables/causes (subject) to (K1+K2)注解：enable可用作正面效果，cause负面效果
2.总起lecture: In the lecture, we heard about a case to illustrate it, which was based on (case description)
3.K1对应： Particularly, we heard from the professor that (I1), which shows that (K1 passive)注解：K1可做变为被动形式，以避免用词重复感
4.K2对应：When it comes to how (K2), there was evidence from the listening that (I2)


> The reading passage gives the definition of XXXX, which means that XXXX    
> The professor uses an example to further explain this concept.    
>  <开始复述听力材料>   



Q5 

为listening+ speaking形式，其中Q5为校园生活内容
